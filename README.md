# NFT Minting Project

This project is a simple DApp which user can mint NFTs through frontend page. The smart contract was written using solidity with hardhat and I used ether.js and Next.js with Tailwind CSS for web3 integration with smart contract. 

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```
